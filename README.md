# AWS ETL POC â€“ S3 + Lambda + Glue

This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates an **ETL pipeline** using AWS services with Terraform for automation.

## ðŸš€ Architecture Overview

1. **S3 Bucket (Raw Zone)** â€“ Stores raw input files uploaded by users or applications.  
2. **Lambda Function** â€“ Triggered automatically when a new file is uploaded to S3. It performs lightweight transformations and/or triggers AWS Glue jobs.  
3. **Glue ETL Job** â€“ Processes and transforms the data, then writes the cleaned data to the **S3 Processed Zone**.  
4. **S3 Bucket (Processed Zone)** â€“ Stores transformed/curated data for analytics or downstream consumption.

## ðŸ”„ Sequence of Events

1. A file is uploaded to the **Raw S3 bucket**.  
2. The **S3 event notification** triggers the **Lambda function**.  
3. Lambda validates and optionally preprocesses the data.  
4. Lambda triggers the **Glue job** for ETL processing.  
5. Glue transforms and stores the output into the **Processed S3 bucket**.
